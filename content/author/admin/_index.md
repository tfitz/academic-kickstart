Welcome to the website of Tim Fitzgerald, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at Gonzaga University. My research interests include nonlinear dynamics, fluid-structure interactions, computational mechanics, and control theory.

I teach a variety of courses here at Gonzaga: from dynamics and vibrations to control theory.  Put another way, I tend to teach topics on mechanical models of things that move.

When not in the lab or classroom, I enjoy backpacking, photography, and making music.
