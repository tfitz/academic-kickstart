 abstract = {In this article, the authors study response localization in coupled arrays of nonlinear oscillators with cubic coupling nonlinearities. For illustration, an array of micro-scale oscillators with intersite or coupling nonlinearities is considered and attention is focused on intrinsic localized modes. Free oscillations and forced oscillations of this system are considered, and the interplay between noise and cubic coupling nonlinearities is studied through numerical studies. These studies help elucidate the role of coupling nonlinearities on energy localization in micro-scale oscillators.},
